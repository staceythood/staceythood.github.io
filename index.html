  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Data Analytics professional with a history of success leading initiatives that use data to solve problems, improve processes, and ensure data quality and integrity. I am well versed in communicating complex or technical information to deliver messages that are easily understood by a range of stakeholders and driving cross-functional collaboration across varied multidisciplinary teams. I earned a certificate in Data Analytics from Rice University. 

    I thrive working with data and collaborating with teams to find solutions and gain new insights. My passions are knowledge and problem solving which led to my interest in data analytics and data science. I am an insatiable learner who loves acquiring new skills and tackling new challenges as demonstrated in the varied roles I have undertaken in my career. Internal audit gave me the opportunity to learn and understand business from a multitude of perspectives - financial, IT, operational, regulatory, etc. The certificate in data analytics has given me the technical skills and tools to build on and complement the knowledge I gained through my work experience.
    
    I am a self-starter who can add value in a collaborative environment, using my technical data skills (Python, SQL, Web, Visualization, etc.) coupled with my extensive business knowledge in multiple industries to solve complex business issues and help organizations make effective decisions for optimal results.</p>
  <br>
  <p>I also like to travel, read, and spend time with my family and friends.</p>
